Feeds should be ordered by date posted. GET /newsfeed Optimization Users should be able to see the only 10 most recent tweets in their news feed. Also think why are we restricting it to 10. You will have to implement pagination for the news feed ( in real system there is infinite scrolling on the UI when user scrolls we call api which is paginated and we keep loading feeds until the li
st is exhausted) Boilerplate code is available :- https://github.com/VJ28/boilerplate_code
